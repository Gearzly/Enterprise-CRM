## Getting Started

1. Ensure TestSprite MCP server is configured and running
2. Install test dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure test environment variables in `.env.test`
4. Run the test suite: `python execution_framework/run_all_tests.py`

## Test Execution Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure database, Redis, and security keys
2. **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components
3. **Integration Testing**: Test API endpoints and database operations
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Validate complete user workflows
5. **Result Analysis**: Review test results and fix any issues
6. **Iterative Testing**: Re-run tests until 100% pass rate achieved

## TestSprite Integration

All tests are designed to be submitted to TestSprite MCP server for automated validation. Each test includes:
- Detailed documentation for TestSprite validation
- Expected outcomes and acceptance criteria
- Error handling and edge case scenarios
- Performance benchmarks and thresholds
