## Key Improvements

1. **Data Models**: All modules now use Pydantic models for proper data validation
2. **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for all entities
3. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP exception handling with meaningful error messages
4. **Data Relationships**: Better linking between related entities (contacts, leads, opportunities)
5. **Filtering**: Added filtering capabilities by status, stage, and other attributes
6. **Comprehensive Fields**: Added all necessary fields for real-world CRM usage
7. **Timestamps**: Added creation and update timestamps for audit trails
8. **Enums**: Used enums for status fields to ensure data consistency

## API Endpoints

The enhanced modules provide RESTful API endpoints for all operations:
- GET (list and retrieve)
- POST (create)
- PUT (update)
- DELETE (remove)
- Specialized endpoints for filtering and reporting

## Data Storage

For demonstration purposes, all modules use in-memory storage. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a proper database implementation.

## Testing

All modules have been tested and verified to work correctly with the FastAPI framework, providing proper JSON responses and error handling.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Database integration (SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL)
- Authentication and authorization
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Pagination for large datasets
- Webhook integrations
- Email notifications
- Audit logging
